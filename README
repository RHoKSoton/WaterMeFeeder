WaterMe
Aim: To make contemporary NDWI data available over the internet and to provide an API to allow further visualisations of the dataset 

Modis data is collected on every region of the globe twice daily by a pair of satellites, we pick ModaT which provides images taken at 10.30 am, this was selected to give the best quality results. 

The Modis data is presented as a series of files, groups of 3 files each reading, a JPG of visible light, an xml file, and an HDF file that stores data specifc to wavelength bands, for our purposes bandOne and bandTwo are used to calculate an NDWI value, this value is a good estimate of the amount of water present in vegetation itself a good indicator of the effect of water shortages.

An API allows for 3rd parties to develop their own visualisations of the NDWI data.

This is the code from the WaterMe project at #RHoKSoton.

To run this code you will need:
* MODIS Reprojection Tool https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool
* Java (as required by the MRT above)
* Python (to run this code) with the following modules:
	gdal
	pymysql
	numpy
* A MySQL database with write permissions

The table you will need must be as below:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Data` (
  `ID` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `latitude` float NOT NULL,
  `longitude` float NOT NULL,
  `bandOne` int(5) NOT NULL,
  `bandTwo` int(5) NOT NULL,
  `bandThree` int(5) NOT NULL,
  `bandFour` int(5) NOT NULL,
  `bandFive` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `bandSix` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `bandSeven` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `vegetation` float NOT NULL,
  `cloud` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  `NDWI` float NOT NULL,
  `timeTaken` datetime NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;
